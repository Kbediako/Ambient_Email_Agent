# Test Review

> Update: The current branch now registers `mark_as_spam_tool` and skips LLM-backed
> memory updates when `EMAIL_ASSISTANT_EVAL_MODE=1`, resolving the first two issues
> captured below. The remaining notes are kept for historical context and future
> improvements.

## Overview
- Created a local virtualenv (`.venv`) and installed project dependencies via `pip install -e .` to satisfy LangChain/LangGraph imports.
- Ran the core pytest targets with `EMAIL_ASSISTANT_EVAL_MODE=1`, `HITL_AUTO_ACCEPT=1`, and `EMAIL_ASSISTANT_SKIP_MARK_AS_READ=1` to exercise deterministic tool-call paths without live Gemini calls.
- Commands executed:
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_response.py -k tool_calls --agent-module=email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail`
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_response.py -k tool_calls --agent-module=email_assistant`
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_spam_flow.py`
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_reminders.py`
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_reminders_langsmith.py`
  - `.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_notebooks.py`

## Test Results
- `tests/test_response.py` (both agent modules) – ✅ pass; early runs emitted `LangGraphDeprecatedSinceV05` warnings due to `StateGraph(..., input=StateInput)` usage at `src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail.py` and `src/email_assistant/email_assistant.py`. This branch migrates those builders to `input_schema`.
- `tests/test_spam_flow.py` – ❌ fails. `interrupt_handler` never emits the expected "Moved message ... to Spam" tool message because `_safe_tool_invoke` cannot find `mark_as_spam_tool`; the tool registry in `src/email_assistant/tools/base.py:33-43` omits this tool, so the agent (and the test) hit `KeyError` and surface `Error executing mark_as_spam_tool` instead.
- `tests/test_reminders.py` – ✅ pass.
- `tests/test_reminders_langsmith.py` – ✅ pass, but takes ~40s due to LangSmith client and dataset lookups.
- `tests/test_notebooks.py` – ✅ pass with benign Jupyter path deprecation warning.

## Key Issues
- **Missing Gmail tool registration**: `get_tools(..., include_gmail=True)` does not add `mark_as_spam_tool`, so even when the graph requests it, `_safe_tool_invoke` fails and the spam flow cannot complete (`tests/test_spam_flow.py:35-57`, `src/email_assistant/tools/base.py:33-44`). The runtime agent will also be unable to execute the HITL-confirmed spam action.
- **Noisy Gemini errors in eval mode**: When tests hit memory updates, the code still calls `get_llm()` and attempts a live Gemini structured output even in eval mode; without credentials this raises 400s (seen in stdout while running `tests/test_spam_flow.py`). Consider short-circuiting memory updates when `EMAIL_ASSISTANT_EVAL_MODE=1` to keep test logs clean and deterministic (`src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail.py:804-849`).

## Gaps & Opportunities
- `tests/run_all_tests.py:70-88` only executes `test_response.py -k tool_calls`, so the reminder, spam-flow, and notebook tests are excluded from the default suite. Incorporating them (or documenting the omission) would improve coverage.
- `test_response.py` limits verification to the presence of expected tool names and ignores ordering/content (`tests/test_response.py:231-251`). Adding assertions on tool-call order or final assistant messages would catch regressions in sequencing.
- The Gmail dataset path defaults `EMAIL_ASSISTANT_EVAL_MODE` to `"0"` (`tests/test_response.py:61-64`), so ad-hoc local runs will try to call live Gemini unless the env var is manually set. Defaulting to "1" for offline predictability (and letting CI opt out) could reduce friction.
- Address the `StateGraph(..., input=...)` deprecation warnings by migrating to `input_schema` (see `src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail.py:975` and `src/email_assistant/email_assistant.py:335`).

## Next Steps
1. Register `mark_as_spam_tool` in `get_tools(..., include_gmail=True)` and re-run `tests/test_spam_flow.py` to verify the spam workflow.
2. Gate memory-update LLM calls behind `EMAIL_ASSISTANT_EVAL_MODE` (or inject a stub) to eliminate 400 errors in automated tests.
3. Expand `tests/run_all_tests.py` to include the reminder, spam, and notebook suites, ensuring CI covers them.
4. Evaluate enhancing `test_response.py` assertions (tool-call ordering, summary checks) once the spam tool fix is merged.
5. Plan a follow-up PR to migrate LangGraph builders to the new `input_schema` signature to silence deprecation warnings.
