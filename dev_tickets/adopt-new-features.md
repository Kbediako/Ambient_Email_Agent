# Optional Feature Adoption – Research Notes

## Overview

Phase 3 of the LangGraph 0.6 upgrade introduced three optional follow-up enhancements. The work is now complete. This document captures the implementation details, validation steps, and residual follow-ups so future contributors understand the current state and remaining opportunities.

Features addressed:

1. Replace bespoke HITL payload dicts with `langgraph.prebuilt.interrupt.HumanInterrupt`.
2. Wrap high side-effect nodes with `langgraph.func.task` for deterministic durability semantics.
3. Swap manual LangSmith pagination helpers for `Client.get_experiment_results()`.

## 1. `HumanInterrupt` Adoption

- **Implementation**: All HITL-capable agents (`email_assistant_hitl`, `email_assistant_hitl_memory`, `email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail`) now construct typed interrupts via `HumanInterrupt`, `ActionRequest`, and `HumanInterruptConfig` (see `src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl.py:137`, `src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory.py:134`, `src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail.py:382`).
- **Benefits**:
  - Enforces LangGraph’s canonical schema so future SDK changes remain compatible.
  - Clarifies allowed actions per interrupt, especially for Gmail-specific HITL flows (send email, scheduling, spam).
- **Testing**:
  - Offline smoke (`pytest tests/test_response.py --agent-module=email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail -k tool_calls`) passes except for known deterministic fallback gaps (see “Follow-ups”).
  - HITL spam flow should be re-run live when Gmail credentials are available to ensure Agent Inbox resumes still deserialize cleanly.
- **Follow-ups**:
  - Update Agent Inbox schema docs/screenshots if UI needs to reflect config flag changes (none observed so far).

## 2. `@task` Wrappers for Side-Effect Nodes

- **Implementation**: All LLM/tool nodes with side effects now expose a `@task`-decorated implementation plus a synchronous wrapper that calls `.result()` (`src/email_assistant/email_assistant.py`, `src/email_assistant/email_assistant_hitl.py`, and memory variants).
- **Rationale**:
  - Aligns with LangGraph guidance so checkpointed runs serialize arguments/results around HITL pauses.
  - Keeps existing `StateGraph` signatures intact by resolving the task future before returning to Pregel.
- **Testing Notes**:
  - Live replays still needed to confirm `durability="sync"` plus task wrappers survive restarts; offline eval verifies structure but not restart semantics.
  - Reminder worker untouched; consider similar treatment if we later migrate it to LangGraph runners.
- **Known Quirk**:
  - The offline deterministic planner in `email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail` still omits the full scheduling tool chain; this existed pre-task adoption and surfaces as judge failures in eval mode.

## 3. `get_experiment_results` Pagination Helper

- **Implementation**: Added `iter_experiment_runs()` to `src/email_assistant/eval/judges.py:719`. `_record_feedback` now falls back to this helper when direct `list_runs` pagination cannot locate the agent child run.
- **Payoffs**:
  - Handles datasets with >100 results without manual offsets.
  - Aligns with LangSmith 0.4.29+ evaluation tooling.
- **Validation**:
  - Local unit tests (`pytest tests/test_judges.py`) still pass.
  - Recommend running `EMAIL_ASSISTANT_LLM_JUDGE=1` live to verify judge feedback attaches correctly in large experiments.

## Residual Follow-ups

- **Deterministic scheduler**: Extend `_fallback_tool_plan` (base agent) and the Gmail eval mode planner to emit the expected `check_calendar` → `schedule_meeting` → `send_email` chain, matching judge policy.
- **Live verification**: Re-run the live smoke suite once Gmail credentials are configured:
  - `pytest tests/test_response.py --agent-module=email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail -k tool_calls`
  - `pytest tests/test_live_smoke.py --agent-module=email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail`
  - `pytest tests/test_live_hitl_spam.py --agent-module=email_assistant_hitl_memory_gmail`
- **Docs**: Consider adding a short section to the Agent Inbox guide explaining the HumanInterrupt payload (action/args/config/description) for future tooling work.
